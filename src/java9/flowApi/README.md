# Reactive Streams with the Flow AP

One of the most notable features introduced in Java 9 is the support for Reactive Streams through the Flow API. 
Reactive Streams aim to simplify the management of asynchronous data flows and non-blocking operations, which is essential 
for creating responsive and high-performance applications. The Flow API in Java 9 is a standard implementation of Reactive 
Streams and provides a solid foundation for asynchronous programming and backpressure management. We will 
explore this feature in detail.

## What is the Flow API?
The Flow API is a new API in the `java.util.concurrent` package that provides a standard interface for asynchronous data flows 
and backpressure management. It consists of four main interfaces:

- **Publisher:** a publisher produces items asynchronously and emits them to subscribers.
- **Subscriber:** a subscriber consumes items produced by a publisher and can request new items, cancel the subscription, or report errors.
- **Subscription:** a subscription represents a connection between a publisher and a subscriber. It allows the subscriber to request items or cancel the subscription.
- **Processor:** a processor is both a publisher and a subscriber, acting as an intermediary to transform or process items.

## Backpressure
Backpressure is a key mechanism in Reactive Streams to prevent data producers from flooding consumers with a stream of 
items too fast to process. The Flow API handles backpressure by allowing subscribers to control the number of items they 
want to receive from the publisher. The subscriber can request a certain number of items via the `request(n) method of the
`Subscription` interface. The publisher must not send more items than those requested by the subscriber.

Here is a basic example to illustrate how to use the Flow API to create a publisher and a subscriber:
```
public class SimplePublisher implements Flow.Publisher<Integer> {
    // Publisher implementation
}

public class SimpleSubscriber implements Flow.Subscriber<Integer> {
    // Subscriber implementation
}
```
In this example, we have defined a simple publisher that produces integers and a subscriber that consumes these integers. 
You need to implement the methods specified by the `Publisher` and `Subscriber` interfaces.

## Conclusion
The Flow API introduced in Java 9 offers a standard implementation of Reactive Streams
