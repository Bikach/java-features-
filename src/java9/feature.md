1. **Module System (Project Jigsaw)**: The module system is the key feature of Java 9, which introduced a new modular structure for organizing and encapsulating Java libraries and applications.

2. **JShell (REPL)**: JShell is a new interactive tool that allows developers to quickly evaluate snippets of Java code without needing to create a full project.

3. **Stream API Improvements**: New methods have been added to the Stream API to improve productivity and ease of use.

4. **Factory Methods for Collections**: Java 9 introduced factory methods to facilitate the creation of immutable collections, such as List, Set, and Map.

5. **ProcessHandle API**: This API allows developers to control and manage operating system processes more efficiently.

6. **Private Interface Methods**: This feature allows for defining private methods in interfaces to avoid code duplication and enhance reusability.

7. **Reactive Streams (Flow API)**: Java 9 added a new Reactive Streams API to facilitate asynchronous communication between components, with a focus on demand-based request and pressure management.

8. **Garbage Collector (GC) Improvements**: The Garbage Collector has been improved to reduce latency and increase performance.

9. **HTTP/2 Client (Incubator)**: A new HTTP/2 client was introduced to support the latest version of the HTTP protocol and enhance performance.

10. **Multi-release JAR files**: This feature allows for creating JAR files that work with multiple versions of Java, including version-specific classes.

11. **Improved Javadoc**: The Javadoc documentation generator has been enhanced with the addition of support for HTML5 tags, a search engine, and other improvements.
